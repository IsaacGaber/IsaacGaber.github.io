        <p>Isaac Gaber is ninteen years old. He is a current sophomore at Sarah Lawrence College in New York with interests in Interactive Media and East Asian Languages. He was born in Berkeley, California, and grew up in between there and Omaha, Nebraska. <!-- Around now, he often begins to regret his decision to spend the coldest part of the year with the cold people of the East Coast. When this begins to happen, he finds walking outside alone for a full day or so lends perspective to his priviledged pessimism.--></p>
