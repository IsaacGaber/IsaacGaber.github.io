          <!-- <p>A blank file can be a pure white or total darkness.The white may expand forever, . While the emptiness expands endlessly, it is not fully infinite; because each unit of emptiness can be quantized. Because of the limits of computer memory, there may only be an ever increasing space of emptiness</p>
          <p>I will make empty applications. The real innovation of computer-based time media is not interaction and response, but in fact one of the truest emptiness's, hidden beneath years of human-generated debris. The fact is, the underlying emptiness has enabled all of the debris accumulated on top. In the applications I will make, the user will surf on the debris, wildly improvising on emptiness.</p>
          <p>The computer will assist them. Another of the great innovations of the information age is the unprecedented ability to feed a computer full of states and from them produce large amounts of seemingly random outcomes. Modern computers house both vast emptiness, and the ability to fill that emptiness with pseudo-random fog in an instant.</p>
          <p>I will create systems that blow away fog and reveal invisible cities beneath.</p> -->
