          <h1><em>Control-J</em> User Manual</h1>

          <p>Stumped. I sit with no idea as to which words logically follow the ones I allegedly marked down onto the page. Nothing left, nothing to look forward to. A flash of light and mechanical inspiration is here. Algorithms burn and convolute only to spawn meaningless digits. The word thief rides again. Meaningless mechanical monotony masquerades as magic.</p>

          <p>Sometimes I can't finish a sentence. What's the right verb, adjective, or noun? I don't know! Overwhelmed and stranded on the precipice, I wrote <em>Control-J</em>. The Program. I slip over the edge.</p>

          <p>The Program is a mechanical plagiarism assistant disguised as a text editor. You may write sentences tailed by punctuation; like in a text editor. Or, you could leave an idea half-finished and trailing off. Just when the sentence begins to de-adhere, you may press "CTRL-J" and let the program finish the rest.</p>

          <p>"Control-J" steals words and phrases from Jane Austen's Brain (<em>Pride and Prejudice</em>) and completes (or hopes to complete) the last sentence you have entered. This program is not original, clever, or coherent.</p>
