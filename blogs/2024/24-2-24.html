          <h1>Jane-Brain User Manual</h1>

          <p>Stumped. I sit with no idea which words logically follow the ones I have already written. Society breaks down. Nothing left, nothing to look forward to. A flash of light; mechanical inspiration is here. Algorithms convolute and spawn meaningless digits. The word thief rides again. Meaningless mechanical monotony masquerades as magic.</p>

          <p>Sometimes I can't finish a sentence. What's the right verb, adjective, or noun? I don't know! Overwhelmed on this precipice, I wrote "Jane-Brain." The Program. She doesn't really help.</p>

          <p>The Program is a mechanical plagiarism assistant disguised as a text editor. You may write sentences tailed by punctuation; like in a text editor. Or, you could leave an idea half-finished and trailing off. Just when the sentence begins to de-adhere, you may press "CTRL-J" and let the program finish the rest.</p>

          <p>All the second halves of ideas, "Jane-Brain" steals from Jane Austen's <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> entirely. The vogue is for programmers to proclaim their machines original. This one isn't. Not a single phrase. The "originality" of the large-language models comes at the expense of the future of the planet. That's why this program isn't.</p>
