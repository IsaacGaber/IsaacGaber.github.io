          <h1>Cloth</h1>
          <p>The taxman is the name for one who takes. The weave of my life has no weaver. I am one of the threads. The fragment of cloth tenses and releases with the daily changes in air pressure as a late-night traveler who wears it for a shawl crosses blooming deserts seeded with copper and lead. Metallic wildflowers sprout from the soil and turn to watch the moonlight reflect off the silver threads of the cloth.</p>

          <p>German-made fabric scissors severed this piece of cloth from the bolt too late on a summer evening when the sun hadn't yet set. Wonder in the gaps between the threads. All under heaven resides there. All empty spaces and the threads to  connect us.</p>

          <p>One becomes more, two becomes less. I become the world I eat. Earth in, Heaven out, all the way around, everything living and everything not. Why do you chew your food then spit it out? Without digestion there's no Heaven and a tear appears in the cloth. Green Earth goes into me goes into the Brown Earth goes into you again. I'm talking about fertilizer and how we can't take from our food what really makes it (which we callously flush down the toilet). The daily cycle of taking from and returning to the living Earth has been destroyed by the freight train and the eighteen-wheeler. I am the soil grows to the heavens returns back under. The farmer is food is the pig is the earthworm eating last year's harvest. Food used to feed the Earth too.</p>
